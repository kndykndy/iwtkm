## Management 101

This chapter is for people reporting to a M. Following chapters show evolution of a person as a
people M on their own.

### What to expect from a manager

Avoid Ms, who:

- are neglectful and ignore you when you need help or make little of your concerns
- avoid meetings with you
- never give feedback to you or give it sporadically and/or unexpectedly
- micromanage

Good M cares about you as a person and actively helps you to grow. They are giving you valuable
feedback and teach important skills. Most importantly, they show you a direction of focus and help
maintain it.

Absolute minimum for a good M is:

#### 1-1s

- they create human connection between you and your M (e.g. it can be easier to ask for extra time
  off if you're in good relations with you M); a good M understands when your energy level changes
  and cares to ask
- regular opportunity for you to speak privately about your concerns; 1-1s should be scheduled with
  predictability; agenda is a shared responsibility;
- 1-1s are not status meetings; if they become those, try replacing communication with a chat or
  emails

#### Feedback and workplace guidance

- it can be pretty disorienting for beginners
- worse than having a behavioural feedback is not getting it at all -- the sooner you get unpleasant
  feedback the easier you can make corrections
- getting praises is important; praise should be public while criticism private
- keep track of all received feedback to add them to a review discussion later
- asking for feedback is a good way to show a respect for a M
- be allies with your M: it helps with feedbacks and with career ladder
- M should show you a large picture and help you feel sense of purpose
- with growth expect to get less feedback and have its focus shifted to a team- and strategy-related
  input

#### Training and career growth

Expect you are reasonable (mostly) for figuring out which training you need. Your M is unlikely to
have a list of e.g. conferences at hand.

What M truly contributes to is promotion and, probably, compensation. On top of that M understands
if you're eligible for promotion. While M usually cannot guarantee promotion, they know how system
works.

### How to be managed

Part of being a good M is figuring out how to be managed. Develop a sense of ownership and
authority.

#### Spend time thinking about what you want

M cannot read your mind and see what makes you happy. It is up to you to figure that out and use
your M to discover what's possible where you are. Know yourself!

#### You are responsible for yourself

Go for what you want! Ask for feedback and take it graciously, even if it is negative. Feel stressed
or unhappy, say that. Asking is usually an uncomfortable way of getting things, get used to it, it
is the fastest way forward. You will not always get what you ask, but that does not mean you should
not do that.

#### Give your manager a break

Your M's job is to do best thing for the company and the team. Your M expects you to bring
solutions, not problems. Try not to make 1-1s all about what you need/want/smth is wrong. Asking for
advice is always a good way to show respect.

#### Choose your managers wisely

Your M can make a huge difference in your career. Evaluating opportunity, try to also consider the
M, and not only company/job/pay. Strong Ms know how to play the game in their company. They can get
you promoted and get attention to you from important ppl, they have strong networks.

  product management, collaboration, tech)
- find the best managers and mentors, and watch them work
