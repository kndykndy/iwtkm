# Identity and Access Management, IAM

## Basics

IAM is Global service, you do not specify a region when using it.

IAM manages:

- centralized control of your AWS account
- shared access to your account
- granular permissions
- multi-factor auth
- ability to provide temporary access to users when necessary
- password rotation policy

**User** is an end user, e.g. employees of an org, etc.

**Group** is a common way to aggregate users. User in a group inherit all permissions from a group.
Groups e.g.: developers, system administrators, HR, etc.

IAM' users and groups are GLOBAL.

**Roles** are assigned to AWS resources, e.g. EC2 instance is not allowed to access S3.

**Policies** provides users, groups and roles with permissions. To set permissions for a group, you
need to apply a JSON-based policy to it.

**Security Group** is a virtual firewall in the cloud.

To use ports you need to explicitly open them.

## Accessing AWS

- visually via AWS Console in a browser
- programmatically via CLI
- programmatically via SDK

**Root account** is the email address used to create an AWS account. It should not be shared with
anyone. Instead, a user for each individual within an org should be created. Root account must be
protected with 2FA (IAM Dashboard).

## IAM Credential Report

A report, listing all users in your account, including information:

- about user pwds: when created, last used, last changed, should be changed next time
- about access keys: is active, last used, last rotated, last service was used with
- MFA: was enabled
